This is a C++ project that I completed for Jason Smith - CS 1337 - UTD.

Goal: develop a C++ program to read answer keys and contestant responses, evaluate scores, and generate statistical reports. 

This program calculates individual scores, identifies incorrect answers, and finds statistical metrics including mean, median, and mode. The program also highlights the most missed questions, providing an overview of the test performance. 

Dynamic memory allocation and custom sorting and counting functions are used to manage and analyze the data efficiently.
